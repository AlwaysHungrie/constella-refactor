# Pineappl Nitro TEE Verifier

Pineappl Nitro TEE verifier is an independent tool that can be used to verify the authenticity of any certificate issued by an Nitro Enabled instance, which includes the instances running on AWS.

Since Constella is running inside a Nitro Enabled instance, it is possible to verify the authenticity of the certificate issued by Constella.

## TODO: Deploy Nitro Verifier and add instructions on how to use it.
