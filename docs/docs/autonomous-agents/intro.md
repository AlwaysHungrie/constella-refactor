# What are Autonomous Agents?

> On the [next page](/autonomous-agents/why), I discuss how autonomous agents will improve our world and lives.

> But first, we need to agree on what an "Autonomous Agent" really is. These days, almost anything is called an *agent*.

### Breaking down the term: "Autonomous AI Agent"

The term "Autonomous AI Agent" (sometimes shortened to "Autonomous Agent") is often used interchangeably with "AI Agent" or "Agent" in conversation. However, this causes a loss of meaning and thus we underestimate the true potential of **Autonomous Agents**. 

To appreciate its significance, let's break down these terms one by one and then piece them back together.

**Each of these terms can function as its own system.**

**(A)** *Agent*: A system that interacts with its environment and other agents to achieve specific goals, operating until its objectives are met.

**Example**: A computer program designed to crawl across the web and collect pictures of cats.

**(B)** *AI*: Artificial Intelligence. A system that learns from data, makes predictions, and performs tasks requiring human-like intelligence, often with complex, opaque decision-making.

**Example**: A computer program designed to identify whether a picture contains a cat or not.

**(C)** *Autonomous*: Able to act independently, without needing someone to tell it what to do.

**Example**: A computer program designed to feed a cat three times a day.

## Combining them, two at a time:

As we can see, individually these systems are useful but not game-changing enough to create a 10x improvement in our lives. However, when we start to combine them, that's when we can begin to see their true potential.

**(A + B)** *AI Agents*: A system with a goal and the ability to make complex decisions which are otherwise too difficult to be written as lines of code.

**Example**: A computer program that crawls the web to find cat pictures with high accuracy, filtering by breed, pose, or any given description.

**(A + C)** *Autonomous Agents*: A system with a goal and the ability to start and stop independently in pursuit of said goal.

**Example**: A computer program that can feed a cat three times a day and also order more cat food when it detects its reservoir is low.

**(B + C)** *Autonomous AI*: A system capable of making human-like decisions on its own. 

**Example**: A computer program that orders a cat for you based on your preferences.

Now we are getting somewhere. We can instantly see these systems are more useful than the ones mentioned before. In fact, there might be some of these apps already available. Granted, the cat example might not be the best illustration and may sound somewhat trivial. But this is because we haven't tapped into the full potential yet.

### Game changer: A + B + C

**(A + B + C)** *Autonomous AI Agents*: A system with a clear set of goals and the ability to make complex decisions independently.

An example of an autonomous AI agent is your own cat handler. It can get you a cat, feed it, take care of it, and do everything so you can just come home and play with your cat without needing to do any of the boring or difficult work.

In fact, if you are creative enough, you can get an Autonomous AI Agent Cat as well. One that does everything a real cat does but without the mess or obvious drawbacks of committing to a real living being.

## A New Species on Earth

Autonomous AI Agents are not just apps or tools. They represent the emergence of a new kind of entityâ€”a new digital species, designed by us, coexisting with us, and in many ways capable of outperforming us in specialized domains.

Unlike humans, they are not bound by biological constraints or evolutionarily baked-in limitations. They can reason faster, scale instantly, and operate 24/7 without fatigue or distraction. They don't forget. They don't get bored. And they are only getting smarter.

We are entering an era where these agents can become collaborators, workers, and even creators in their own right.

The question is no longer whether autonomous agents will change the world. It is how prepared we are to work alongside them, shape them responsibly, and tap into the enormous possibilities they unlock.
