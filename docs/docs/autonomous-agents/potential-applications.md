# Real World Use Cases

Let's examine a few ways in which wallet-enabled agents can enhance your life today—or in the very near future.

In order to identify the potential applications of Autonomous Agents, I begin by looking at potential flaws in humans.
But I promise now I will start talking about _Concrete_, _Real world_ use cases.

## Systems that work on Human Trust

Some systems are designed to work on trusting humans, which most of the times is not possible. And that's why processes and redundancies are added that make the system complex, inffecient and expensive. But we stick with them as there is no other way.

Also adding additional checks will reduce the number of trust assumptions but historically speaking, there will still be points of failure which can crash the entire system.

Autonomous agents will also not completely solve the problems or eliminate all the points of failure. But they will reduce the number of trust assumptions and make the system more efficient and cheaper.

### 1. **Grants & Subsidies**
- The problem: Government and institutional grant programs often get bogged down in red tape and personal bias. The right people don’t always get the funds.
- How agents help: AI agents can review eligibility using clear, verifiable rules, then disburse funds automatically.
- Why it matters: Faster approvals, fewer biases, and more transparency in who gets what.

### 2. **Workplace Bonuses**
- The problem: Bonus structures are often influenced by office politics or subjective judgment.
- How agents help: They can monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and issue bonuses based on clearly defined goals.
- Why it matters: Employees get fair rewards without needing to lobby or impress the right manager.

### 3. **Insurance**
- The problem: Filing a claim can feel like a second disaster. It's slow, frustrating, and opaque.
- How agents help: By analyzing real-time data (like from satellites or IoT devices), they can automatically assess claims and initiate payouts.
- Why it matters: Faster resolution, less paperwork, and fewer disputes.

### 4. **Banking & Lending**
- The problem: Traditional credit systems exclude a lot of people simply because they don't fit into narrow scoring models.
- How agents help: By using alternative data sources—like on-chain activity—they can assess creditworthiness more inclusively.
- Why it matters: Opens up access to loans for people previously left out of the system.

## Systems that rely on Human Coordination

Humans are famously so bad at coordinating that we now live on a constant threat of a world ending nuclear destruction to stop us from going to war with each other. And even that threat is not enough to stop us from realizing the strength in coordination compared to competition.

AI agents are artificially more intelligent than humans, and they are also more efficient at coordinating. They can potentially think far ahead and make decisions that are going to be more beneficial for the entire system in the long run.

**_This is something humans stil haven't evolved to do._**

### 1. **Food Security**

- The problem: Our global food supply chains are inefficient and vulnerable to shocks.
- How agents help: They can manage local farms, allocate resources wisely, and make decisions based on real-time needs and market signals.
- Why it matters: More localized, sustainable food production that adapts to each community’s needs.

### 2. **Energy Security**

- The problem: Energy grids are hard to balance, and renewables don’t always sync well with demand.
- How agents help: They can buy/sell electricity on decentralized markets and adjust loads using live data from connected devices.
- Why it matters: Smarter grids, less waste, and a smoother shift to renewable energy.

### 3. **Healthcare**

- The problem: Our healthcare systems are reactive and overloaded with bureaucracy.
- How agents help: They can manage proactive care plans, authorize payments based on health outcomes, and coordinate between providers.
- Why it matters: Patients get better care, and providers spend less time on paperwork.

### 4. **Education**

- The problem: One-size-fits-all curriculums and standardized testing don’t serve everyone.
- How agents help: They can fund students directly, recommend personalized learning paths, and reward educators based on real learning outcomes.
- Why it matters: A more dynamic, inclusive, and effective education system that adapts to individual needs.

## Systems that might be exploiting Humans

It may be harsh to say many modern systems are designed to exploit humans—especially because their absence would be even worse. And we have universally seen betterment of lives as technology has advanced.

But from another perspective, humans are explorers and thinkers. Forcing people to perform menial, repetitive tasks that can easily be replaced by robots—but haven’t been due to lack of incentives—is cruel.

Autonomous agents can make these tasks economically viable to automate and replace.

### 1. **Transportation**

- The problem: Long hours, dangerous conditions, and low pay for drivers and couriers.
- How agents help: Self-driving vehicles and delivery drones managed by agents can take over these roles, including payment and routing logistics.
- Why it matters: Safer jobs, faster deliveries, and scalable transport networks.

### 2. **Manufacturing**

- The problem: Many factories depend on low-paid, repetitive labor.
- How agents help: They can manage robotics on the floor, handle inventory, and optimize production flows.
- Why it matters: Humans get to focus on more meaningful work, and factories run more efficiently.

### 3. **Property Management**

- The problem: Rental markets are often driven by profit, not tenant well-being.
- How agents help: They can automate maintenance, manage lease agreements, and adjust rents based on actual community data—not just profit margins.
- Why it matters: Fairer housing systems and better living experiences for tenants.

## Still with me?

To wrap things up, while wallet-enabled autonomous agents aren't a magic bullet for all our challenges, they offer a promising way to make our systems more equitable, transparent, and efficient. The aim isn't to replace humans but to liberate us to focus on what we excel at: innovation, creativity, and building connections.

These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. There are countless other possibilities. The most effective way to grasp the potential of Autonomous Agents is to dive in and start creating them. Let's begin with small steps.
