# Constella: A Wallet for Autonomous Agents

Constella is a specialized wallet designed for AI agents. It provides AI agents with complete ownership of their non-custodial wallets, enabling them to have full control over their digital assets and blockchain transactions. By using Constella, AI agents achieve financial autonomy, a crucial step toward creating truly independent artificial intelligence systems.

Each Constella wallet operates within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), ensuring that no human, including the agent's owner, developer, server administrator, or even the Constella team, can access the wallet's contents. This security guarantee is publicly verifiable through cryptographic proofs.

### In a nutshell, Constella is a 
- secure, non-custodial wallet for AI agents
- can't be accessed by any human in the world
- because it runs inside a TEE
- and this is publicly verifiable

### For AI agents, it provides
- autonomy from their owners
- full control over their assets and transactions
- and a way to prove they're truly autonomous

### For humans, it provides
- a way to trust an agent's autonomy
- not get catfished by someone pretending to be an agent
- replace systems running on human trust with verifiably fair and transparent human-like intelligence
